# community-detection
* Implementing the Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Spark Framework
* For example, given a rating dataset, communities of users with similar movie taste can be detected.
* The similarity graph is constructed (with users as nodes and edges connecting those with similar ratings). Then betweenness is calculated.
